# Learning goals: Period 1

## Explain and reflect

### Differences between Java and JavaScript + node.
- Java is a compiled language and JavaScript a scripted language
- Java is both a language and a platform
- General differences in language features.
- Blocking vs. non-blocking
  
### NodeJS & npm - when does it "Make sense" to use
Explain generally about node.js, when it “makes sense” and ​npm​, and how it “fits” into the node echo system.
  
### The Event Loop in JavaScript
including terms like; blocking, non-blocking, event loop, callback queue and  other API's. Make sure to include why this is relevant for us as developers.
  
### What does it mean if a method in nodes API's ends with xyzSync​?
asd  

<h3 style="color: yellow">The JavaScript Engine and JavaScript Runtime Environment</h3>
Explain the terms JavaScript Engine (name at least one) and JavaScript Runtime Environment (name at least two)
  
<h3 style="color: yellow">Babel & WebPack</h3>
Explain (some) of the purposes with the tools ​Babel ​and ​WebPack and how they differ from each other​. Use examples from the exercises.

## Explain using sufficient code examples the following features in JavaScript (and node)

### Variable/function-Hoisting
asd

### this​ in JavaScript and how it differs from what we know from Java/.net.

### Explain the methods ​map​, ​filter​ ​and ​reduce
asd
    
### Provide examples of user-defined reusable modules implemented in Node.js (learnynode - 6)
asd
  
### Provide examples and explain the es2015 features: ​let, arrow functions, this, rest parameters, destructuring objects and arrays,​ ​ maps/sets​ etc.
asd

### Explain and demonstrate, how to implement event-based code, how to emit events and how to listen for such events

## ES6,7,8,ES-next and TypeScript


### Provide examples with es-next, running in a browser, using Babel and Webpack
asd
  
### Explain the two strategies for improving JavaScript: Babel and ES6 + ES-Next, versus Typescript.
asd
  
### What does it require to use these technologies: In our backend with Node and in (many different) Browsers
asd
  
### Provide​ examples​ to demonstrate the benefits of using TypeScript, including, types, interfaces, classes and generics
asd
  
### Explain how we can get typescript code completion for external imports.
asd 
  
### Explain the ECMAScript Proposal Process for how new features are added to the language (the TC39 Process)
asd
  
## Callbacks, Promises and async/await

### ES-6 promises in JavaScript
including, the problems they solve, a quick explanation of the Promise API and:

### how to avoid the callback hell (“Pyramid of Doom")
asd
  
### How to execute asynchronous (promise-based) code in ​serial​ or parallel
asd
  
### How to implement ​your own​ promise-solutions.
asd
  
### Example(s) that demonstrate error handling with promises
asd 
  

### JavaScripts ​async/await​
how it relates to promises and reasons to use it compared to the plain promise API.  
Provide examples to demonstrate
#### Why this often is the preferred way of handling promises
asd
  
#### Error handling with async/await
asd
  
#### Serial or parallel execution with async/await.
