## Node & Express


**Explain Pros & Cons in using Node.js + Express to implement your Backend compared to a strategy using, for example, Java/JAX-RS/Tomcat**  
asd

<br>

**Explain the difference between Debug outputs and ApplicationLogging. What’s wrong with console.log(..) statements in our backend code?**  
asd

<br>

**Demonstrate a system using application logging and environment controlled debug statements.**  
asd

<br>

**Explain, using relevant examples, concepts related to testing a REST-API using Node/JavaScript/Typescript + relevant packages**  
asd

<br>

**Explain a setup for Express/Node/Test/Mongo-DB/GraphQL development with Typescript, and how it handles "secret values",  debug, debug-outputs, application logging and testing.**  
asd

<br>

**Explain, preferably using an example, how you have deployed your node/Express applications, and which of the Express Production best practices you have followed.**  
asd

<br>

**Explain possible steps to deploy many node/Express servers on the same droplet, how to deploy the code and how to ensure servers will continue to operate, even after a droplet restart.**  
asd

<br>

**Explain, your chosen strategy to deploy a Node/Express application including how to solve the following deployment problems:**

*Ensure that you Node-process restarts after a (potential) exception that closed the application*  
asd

*Ensure that you Node-process restarts after a server (Ubuntu) restart*  
asd

*Ensure that you can run “many” node-applications on a single droplet on the same port (80)*  
asd

<br>

**Explain, using relevant examples, the Express concept; middleware.**  
asd

<br>

**Explain, conceptually and preferably also with some code, how middleware can be used to handle problems like logging, authentication, cors and more.**  
asd

<br>

**Explain, using relevant examples, your strategy for implementing a REST-API with Node/Express  + TypeScript and demonstrate how you have tested the API.**  
asd

<br>

**Explain, using relevant examples, how to test JavaScript/Typescript Backend Code, relevant packages (Mocha, Chai etc.) and how to test asynchronous code.**  
asd

<br>


## NoSQL and MongoDB 
**Explain, generally, what is meant by a NoSQL database.**    
asd

<br>

**Explain Pros & Cons in using a NoSQL database like MongoDB as your data store, compared to a traditional Relational SQL Database like MySQL.**    
asd

<br>

**Explain about indexes in MongoDB, how to create them, and demonstrate how you have used them.**    
asd

<br>

**Explain, using your own code examples, how you have used some of MongoDB's "special" indexes like TTL and 2dsphere and perhaps also the Unique Index.**    
asd

<br>

**Demonstrate, using a REST-API designed by you, how to perform all CRUD operations on a MongoDB**  
asd

<br>

**Explain, using a relevant example, a full JavaScript backend including relevant test cases to test the REST-API (not on the production database)**  
asd

<br>

**Demonstrate, using your own code-samples, decisions you have made regarding → normalization vs denormalization**  
asd
