Explain Pros & Cons in using Node.js + Express to implement your Backend compared to a strategy using, for example, Java/JAX-RS/Tomcat
Explain the difference between Debug outputs and ApplicationLogging. What’s wrong with console.log(..) statements in our backend code?
Demonstrate a system using application logging and environment controlled debug statements.
Explain, using relevant examples, concepts related to testing a REST-API using Node/JavaScript/Typescript + relevant packages 
Explain a setup for Express/Node/Test/Mongo-DB/GraphQL development with Typescript, and how it handles "secret values",  debug, debug-outputs, application logging and testing.

Explain, preferably using an example, how you have deployed your node/Express applications, and which of the Express Production best practices you have followed.
Explain possible steps to deploy many node/Express servers on the same droplet, how to deploy the code and how to ensure servers will continue to operate, even after a droplet restart.
Explain, your chosen strategy to deploy a Node/Express application including how to solve the following deployment problems:
Ensure that you Node-process restarts after a (potential) exception that closed the application
Ensure that you Node-process restarts after a server (Ubuntu) restart
Ensure that you can run “many” node-applications on a single droplet on the same port (80)

Explain, using relevant examples, the Express concept; middleware.
Explain, conceptually and preferably also with some code, how middleware can be used to handle problems like logging, authentication, cors and more.
Explain, using relevant examples, your strategy for implementing a REST-API with Node/Express  + TypeScript and demonstrate how you have tested the API.
Explain, using relevant examples, how to test JavaScript/Typescript Backend Code, relevant packages (Mocha, Chai etc.) and how to test asynchronous code.

NoSQL and MongoDB 
Explain, generally, what is meant by a NoSQL database.
      Explain Pros & Cons in using a NoSQL database like MongoDB as your data store, compared to a traditional Relational SQL Database like MySQL.
 Explain about indexes in MongoDB, how to create them, and demonstrate how you have used them.
Explain, using your own code examples, how you have used some of MongoDB's "special" indexes like TTL and 2dsphere and perhaps also the Unique Index.
Demonstrate, using a REST-API designed by you, how to perform all CRUD operations on a MongoDB
Explain, using a relevant example, a full JavaScript backend including relevant test cases to test the REST-API (not on the production database)
      Demonstrate, using your own code-samples, decisions you have made regarding → normalization vs denormalization 
Geo-location and Geojson (Period-4)
Explain and demonstrate basic Geo-JSON, involving as a minimum, Points and Polygons
Explain and demonstrate ways to create Geo-JSON test data
Explain the typical order of longitude and latitude used by Server-Side APIs and Client-Side APIs
Explain and demonstrate a REST API that implements geo-features, using a relevant geo-library and plain JavaScript
 Explain and demonstrate a REST API that implements geo-features, using Mongodb’s geospatial queries and indexes.
Explain and demonstrate how you have tested the gameFacade and gameAPI for the game-related parts of the period exercises
This will come in period-5
Explain and demonstrate a React Native Client that uses geo-components (Location, MapView, etc.)
Explain and demonstrate both server and client-side, of the geo-related parts of your implementation of the ongoing semester case.
